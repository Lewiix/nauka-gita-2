        <h2>Where Is the Love?</h2>
        <p>What's wrong with the world, mama?
        People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
        I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
        Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
        </p>
        <p>
        Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
        But we still got terrorists here livin'
        In the USA, the big CIA
        The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
        </p>
        <p>
        But if you only have love for your own race
        Then you only leave space to discriminate
        And to discriminate only generates hate
        And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
